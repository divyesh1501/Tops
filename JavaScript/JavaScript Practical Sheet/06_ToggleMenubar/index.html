        <p>Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things,[1] and also refers to the
            valuable things themselves. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right
            to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away, or destroy
            it, or to exclude others from doing these things,[2] as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of
            the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it under the granted property
            rights.</p>

        <p>In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public
            property, and collective property (also called cooperative property).[3] Property that jointly belongs to
            more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether
            simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will
            (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional,[citation needed] to
            distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or
            alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of a dispute with any other of
            them exists, may expect his, her, it's or their own will to be sufficient and absolute. The first
            Restatement defines property as anything, tangible or intangible, whereby a legal relationship between
            persons and the State enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating
            relationship between individual, property, and State is called a property regime.[4]</p>

        <p>In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals
            and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The
            distinction between "collective property" and "private property" is regarded as confusion since different
            individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.[5][6]</p>

        <p>Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the ground),
            personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal
            persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (State-owned or publicly owned
            and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions,
            etc.). However, the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced.[7] An article of property may have
            physical and incorporeal parts. A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the
            property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees
            fit.[citation needed] The unqualified term "property" is often used to refer specifically to real property.
