            <h3>AppleCare+ and AppleCare Protection Plan</h3>
        <p>Every Apple Display, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPad, iPod, iPhone, HomePod, Mac, and AirPods comes with complimentary telephone technical support and a limited warranty from Apple. The AppleCare Protection Plan and AppleCare+ extends the service coverage and provides one-stop service and support from Apple experts.[3]</p>

        <p>The AppleCare Protection Plan is sold by Apple and its authorized resellers for Apple TV and AirPort exclusively and must be phrased at the time of purchase or AppleCare Protection Plan must be purchased within 30 days in Japan and within 60 days where available.[4][5] AppleCare+ is available as an add-on purchase with every Apple Display, Apple Watch, iPad, iPod, iPhone, HomePod, Mac, and AirPods at the time of purchase; otherwise AppleCare+ or AppleCare Protection Plan must be purchased within 30 days in Japan and within 60 days where available.[4]</p>

        <p>For all hardware devices, following the included 90-day telephone/Internet support and one-year hardware warranty, buying the AppleCare Protection Plan for a MacBook computer or a separate AppleCare Protection Plan for Apple displays extends both support and hardware to three years.[6] Additionally, buying AppleCare+ for iPods and other iOS devices can extend both support and hardware to two years. Extended coverage under the Protection Plan is available for the Apple Watch for either two or three years, depending on the particular model of the device.[7] The AppleCare Protection Plan extends the complimentary 90-day coverage to three years from the original device purchase date for Mac or Apple displays and two years from the given device's purchase date for iPads, iPhones, iPods, or Apple TV devices.[8]</p>

        <p>AppleCare also includes an express replacement service for iPad and iPhone. AppleCare+ insures against accidental damage, unlike the statutory warranty.[9] For Mac computers with or without any additional included covered Mac accessories, (or separately purchased Apple monitors with their own purchased Apple Protection Plan) this still extends cover to a third year from the statutory two years.</p>

        <h3>AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss coverage</h3>
        <p>Theft and loss coverage is only provided in Japan, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Germany.[10] AppleCare+ with theft and loss includes up to two incidents of accidental damage, theft or loss coverage at a reduced cost to the end consumer.[11] Currently Theft and Loss coverage is unavailable in some parts of Europe, South America, Asia Pacific, Africa, North America (Canada) or Antarctica.</p>

        <h3>Included Mac accessory coverage</h3>
        <p>Users who purchase an AppleCare Protection Plan with any Mac computer are also automatically entitled to receive coverage for some other related Apple accessories. Along with coverage for the MacBook, any additional Apple display purchased at the same time as a Macbook device and/or any Apple AirPort device (e.g., AirPort Express Base Station, AirPort Extreme Base Station, or Time Capsule) is covered. (Note: Although the AirPort device or Time Capsule must be purchased up to two years before the MacBook purchase or during the term of the AppleCare Protection Plan coverage).[8]</p>

        <h3>Competition</h3>
        <p>Today, there are several third-party warranty providers and traditional insurance providers that will also cover Apple products. Some may include accident, loss, and theft coverage as well as hardware failure warranties. Some major retailers that sell Apple products sell their own extended service plans as well.</p>
